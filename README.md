[Original](https://meowing-ceres-b53.notion.site/Mini-Calendly-App-7bcb17d34e644d97bb9d69d3aff3df90)

Please create an app which will satisfy next business logic.

I am John, I am CEO of Tech Company, and I want to have One-to-One sessions with my employees. To make sure that I will find this time I need to book slots in my agenda.

I want to have possibility to choose from Monday to Friday my free spots, and depending on selected spots system should generate available slots for my employees.

```jsx
I pick 12:00 - 14:00 and step(duration) 15 min for Monday;
I pick 16:00 - 18:00 and step(duration) 30 min for Friday;

for rest of the days, it should be impossible to select any spot.

// When employee select date for example 1 July 2024 (Monday) he will see next
// available spots

12:00 12:15 12:30 12:45 13:00 13:15 13:30 13:45

// When employee select date for example 5 July 2024 (Friday) he will see next
// available spots

16:00 16:30 17:00 17:30
```

1. When employee select date & free spot, I should receive a notification via email and also google calendar event.
   _Hints: ical file should be attached in my email notification_
2. Selected spot should be eliminated from list, for avoiding overlapping.
3. In case if all spots are occupied for selected days, letâ€™s have an additional endpoint which will sugerate the nears free slot for user
   _(Ex: In case if my schedule is occupied for 2 weeks from 1 Jul to 14 Jul, and user select 5 Jul then the nears slot will be 12:00 for 15 Jul)_

**From technical point of view:**

- Solution should be on NestJS Framework
- PostgresSQL & TypeORM
- DTO Validations
- Documentation
